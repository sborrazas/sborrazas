:description: The styleguides I use and why


Lately I've been involved in creating different stylguides for building web
applications. These include an [HTML Styleguide](https://github.com/sborrazas/html-styleguide),
a [CSS Styleguide](https://github.com/sborrazas/css-styleguide), a
[JavaScript Styleguide](https://github.com/sborrazas/js-styleguide) and a
[Ruby Styleguide](https://github.com/sborrazas/rb-styleguide).

The reason for making these, is that whenever I start a new project with a new
team of people, we usually have a few different ways of writing code. And we
usually end up having a few conflicts with it. When, in the end, we all just
want to have consistency in terms of how we write code, regardless of what we
want the standard to be.

These stylguides were built taking the standards from each community and putting
them all together. I tried to make them exhaustive so as not to leave any detail
unspecified. I've also included a few samples in some of them. If you want to
contribute or discuss any of these, please don't hesistate to do so!
