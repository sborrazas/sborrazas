:description: Book review of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance by Robert M. Pirsig

_Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: An Inquiry Into Values_ is a thought
provoking book on very profound philosophical questions. It is delivered as a
story of the author on a trip with his son, while a bunch of philosophical
thoughts of his are given in the form of a first-person monologue.

The aspects that stuck the most and for which I enjoyed the book the most are
about **dealing with technology and craftsmanship** and the perception of
reality.

It mentions two different views and attitutes towards reality, a classic and a
romantic one. The classic view values technology, while the romantic view
condemns it. People involved with the romantic approach run away from
technology, they live with it but are completely detached. They see
technology as an outsider. The classic approach cares about technology, and
tries to understand it to the fullest, to the point where it becomes part of
one.

As a someone that has to work with technology, this hits home. What should my
attitude towards technology be? This book is a great companion to take while
trying to answer this question.
